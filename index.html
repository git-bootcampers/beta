        <p align style="color: red; text-align: center; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 300px; text-align: justify">The story weaves in and out of true historical facts that transpired during the 1400s. It is set in four parts, preceded by several prologues. Part One features Matthias as a seven-year-old, unaware that his only real friend – an old hermit –is
            in fact possessed by the rose demon.The Rosifer is able to possess most people, depending on their soul’s strength and will power. Throughout the novel he reappears in numerous guises, though on most occasions Matthias seldom guesses that
            his latest friend – or enemy – is possessed until the demon decides to make himself known.The Rosifer appears mainly in this first part and is featured less and less as the narrative progresses. As a result, I became less and less engaged
            with the book.The relationship between the demon – in the guise of the hermit – and the young Matthias is a key factor that makes this so good. None of the demon’s other possessions are as entertaining as the hermit, while Matthias the boy
            is more interesting than Matthias the man.That said, the Rosifer is such a strong character that whoever he pops up as, he immediately spices up whatever situation Matthias is faced with. </p>
        <p align style="color: red; text-align: center; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 300px; text-align: justify">But as the demon’s interventions becomes fewer and far between, the storyline becomes too repetitive. Matthias gets hit over the head and wakes up somewhere new. Matthias is captured with death hovering above him. Matthias keeps dreaming about
            certain past events. And on the whole his life seems too full and varied to be believed.</p>
        <p align style="color: red; text-align: center; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 300px; text-align: justify">Speaking of true events, Richard III did not kill his brother, George Duke of Clarence, as is stated here by one of the characters; Edward IV had him executed, which didn’t go down well with Richard. Richard does briefly appear in the story when
            he was the Duke of Gloucester and is described as having red hair – unless I’m colour blind, it’s brown in every portrait I’ve seen of him</p>
