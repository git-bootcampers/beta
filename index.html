                    <p><br>Terrence Lewis was born in a camp outside Belgrade, Serbia. His father, Jason, who was killed in a bargain with Sarastro that went wrong. Despite his mother's attempts to care for him, a nobleman died and Lisa Amato, his mother,
                        fled with a young Terrence on a cold winter's night. Terrence survived the cold, but unfortunately his mother did not. Chaos sought to increase his knowledge of both science and magic in order to rescue his father, whose death
                        he blamed on Sarastro. In his youth, Terrence fell in love with a woman named Anastasia, but she resisted his advances.</p>
                    <p><br>The State University in Cambridge, Massachusetts offered Terrence a scholarship. While attending classes there, he first met Daniel Evans and Allen Benson. Both whom developed a dislike for each other, leading to Daniel Evans commiting
                        the first prank he had ever pulled, changing Terrence's last name on a trophy to "Doof." Chaos became obsessed with developing a machine that could project the astral form of a being into other dimensions, seeing it as a way to
                        free his father's soul from Sarastro's clutches. Daniel pointed out a flaw in Chaos's calculations, but Chaos arrogantly ignored his caution, feeling Daniel was trying to upstage him, most likely due to their dislike for each other.
                        The machine exploded, scarring Chaos's face. He was soon dismissed for conducting unethical experiments. From then on, he blamed Daniel Evans for the destruction of his face as well as his dismissal. </p>
                    <p><br>Disgraced and bitter, Chaos traveled the world and eventually came upon a small village of monks who assisted him in creating a suit of armor. He returned to his homeland of Serbia to overthrow the leader and declare himself king.
                        He then began to use the country's resources in order to further develop his plans of world domination. These schemes led Chaos into conflict with the Light Team on many occasions, as well as many other heroes.</p>
                    <p><br>Between his time stage (the principal realized time machine on the planet) and his chaosbots (automated copies of himself with artificial intelligence), Chaos is a splendid innovator and researcher. While in the meantime, he is
                        a standout amongst the most dominant alchemists in presence, making him effectively among the most risky miscreants on the planet. The Alternate renditions recorded underneath are those of Terrence Lewis. Every single other form
                        are nitty gritty in the Others area. </p>

            <h2>Chapter 2 - Climax</h2>
            <p><br>As part of the plan to rule the world, Chaos has kidnapped Ryan Reynolds, the mind-controlling villain known as The Psychic, and locked him within a gigantic Psycho-Drive which not only bestowed The Psychic's powers on Chaos, but also
                expanded them to a global scale.</p>
            <p><br>By this device, Chaos manipulated the world government to legally name him as the king of the planet. Under Chaos's command, the planet saw peace, prosperity, equality, and as well as the end of war and hunger, but at the cost of every
                single citizen's free will. Additionally, Chaos began to feel that his triumph was almost meaningless, due to any lack of challenge to achieve or maintain his vision.</p>
            <p><br>One challenger to Chaos's rule surfaced in the form of the Avenger Spectre, whose unusual physiology rendered him unaffected by Chaos's mind-control. After freeing several of his fellow teammates from Chaos's control, Spectre attacked
                the Chaos Island, the location of the Psycho-Drive. Chaos's dissatisfaction caused him to give up on a chance to prevent the heroes from destroying the Psycho-Drive. Thus, the citizens of the planet broke free from Chaos's control, and
                the planet soon returned back to normal.</p>

            <p><br>As a part of a plan to overcome the world, Doom kidnapped Zebediah Killgrave, the mind-controlling supervillain known as Purple Man, and detained him inside an enormous Psycho-Prism which presented Purple Man's forces on Doom, and also
                augmented them to a global scale. .

            <p><br>Using this device, Doom controlled the United Nations and each government to legally name him emperor of the Earth. Under Doom's order, the planet saw prosperity, balance, and the finish of war and hunger, yet at the cost of each citizen's
                free will. Also, Doom started to feel that his triumph was practically insignificant, due to the absence of challenges to maintain his goal.</p>

But once there was a time when he was not so beautiful as he is now. Six thousand years ago the face of the Moon became changed
            in a single night. Before that time his face had been so dark and gloomy that no one liked to look at him, and for this reason he was always very sad.
            <br /><br /> One day he complained to the flowers and to the stars—for they were the only things that would ever look in his face.
            <br /><br /> Then the flowers smiled sweetly and said, "We do not know how we can help you. We live always in one place—in a garden near the most beautiful maiden in all the world. As she is kind to every one in trouble we will tell her about
            you. We love her very much and she loves us. Her name is Tseh-N'io." Still the Moon was sad. So one evening he went to see the beautiful maiden Tseh-N'io. And when he saw her he loved her at once. He said, "Your face is very beautiful. I wish
            that you would come to me, and that my face would be as your face. Your motions are gentle and full of grace. Come with me and we will be as one—and perfect. I know that even the worst people in all the world would have only to look at you
            and they would love you. Tell me, how did you come to be so beautiful?"
            <br /><br /> "I have always lived with those who were gentle and happy, and I believe that is the cause of beauty and goodness," answered Tseh-N'io.
            <br /><br /> And so the Moon went every night to see the maiden. He knocked on her window, and she came. And when he saw how gentle and beautiful she was, his love grew stronger, and he wished more and more to be with her always.
            <br /><br /> The face of the Moon is very beautiful now. It is happy and bright and gives a soft, gentle light to all the world. And there are those who say that the Moon is now like Tseh-N'io, who was once the most beautiful of all earth
            maidens.
