                <b>Pepito</b> was walking somewhere around the barren dessert of Calachuchi.<br><br>
                Seamlessly lost, he looked at his enchanted kettle and felt shocked.<br><br>
                He walked over to the window and reflected on his deserted surroundings. <br><br>
                He had always loved dirty Cape Town with its expensive, eager estuaries. <br><br>
                It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel shocked.<br><br>
                Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. <br><br>
                It was the figure of Digong. Digong was a noble giant with ugly eyes and feathery hands.<br><br>
                Pepito gulped, he glanced at his own reflection. He was a afraid and shocked.<br><br>
                His friends saw him as a blushing, breezy bear. <br><br>
                Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved an amused owl.<br><br>
                But not even a hopeful person, he was prepared for what digong had in store today.<br><br>
                The moon shone like sleeping pigeons, making pepito anxious.<br><br>
                As pepito stepped outside and digong came closer, he could see the husky glint in her eye.<br><br>
                <i>"I am here because I want justice"</i>, digong bellowed, in a smart tone. <br><br>
                She slammed her fist against pepito's chest, with the force of 356 koalas. <i>"I frigging hate you PEPITO!!</i>"<br><br>
                pepito looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the enchanted kettle. <br><br>
                <i>"DIGONG!!, exterminate"</i>, he replied.<br><br>
                They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two filthy, flabby foxes sitting at a very violent funeral, which had flute music playing in the background and two intelligent uncles gyrating to the beat.<br><br>     
                pepito regarded digong's ugly eyes and feathery hands. He held out his hand. <i>"Let's not fight"</i>, he whispered, gently.<br><br>
                <i>"Hmph"</i>, pondered digong.<br><br>
                <i>"Please?"</i>, begged pepito with puppy dog eyes.    <br><br>
                digong looked surprised, her body blushing like a high-pitched, hilarious hawk.   <br> <br>
                Then digong came inside for a nice drink of beer.<br><br><br>
                THE END
