But once there was a time when he was not so beautiful as he is now. Six thousand years ago the face of the Moon became changed
            in a single night. Before that time his face had been so dark and gloomy that no one liked to look at him, and for this reason he was always very sad.
            <br /><br /> One day he complained to the flowers and to the stars—for they were the only things that would ever look in his face.
            <br /><br /> Then the flowers smiled sweetly and said, "We do not know how we can help you. We live always in one place—in a garden near the most beautiful maiden in all the world. As she is kind to every one in trouble we will tell her about
            you. We love her very much and she loves us. Her name is Tseh-N'io." Still the Moon was sad. So one evening he went to see the beautiful maiden Tseh-N'io. And when he saw her he loved her at once. He said, "Your face is very beautiful. I wish
            that you would come to me, and that my face would be as your face. Your motions are gentle and full of grace. Come with me and we will be as one—and perfect. I know that even the worst people in all the world would have only to look at you
            and they would love you. Tell me, how did you come to be so beautiful?"
            <br /><br /> "I have always lived with those who were gentle and happy, and I believe that is the cause of beauty and goodness," answered Tseh-N'io.
            <br /><br /> And so the Moon went every night to see the maiden. He knocked on her window, and she came. And when he saw how gentle and beautiful she was, his love grew stronger, and he wished more and more to be with her always.
            <br /><br /> The face of the Moon is very beautiful now. It is happy and bright and gives a soft, gentle light to all the world. And there are those who say that the Moon is now like Tseh-N'io, who was once the most beautiful of all earth
            maidens.
