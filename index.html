            <p><br>Terrence Lewis was born in a camp outside Belgrade, Serbia. His father, Jason, who was killed in a bargain with Sarastro that went wrong. Despite his mother's attempts to care for him, a nobleman died and Lisa Amato, his mother, fled with a young Terrence on a cold winter's night. Terrence survived the cold, but unfortunately his mother did not. Chaos sought to increase his knowledge of both science and magic in order to rescue his father, whose death he blamed on Sarastro. In his youth, Terrence fell in love with a woman named Anastasia, but she resisted his advances.</p>
            <p><br>The State University in Cambridge, Massachusetts offered Terrence a scholarship. While attending classes there, he first met Daniel Evans and Allen Benson. Both whom developed a dislike for each other, leading to Daniel Evans commiting the first prank he had ever pulled, changing Terrence's last name on a trophy to "Doof." Chaos became obsessed with developing a machine that could project the astral form of a being into other dimensions, seeing it as a way to free his father's soul from Sarastro's clutches. Daniel pointed out a flaw in Chaos's calculations, but Chaos arrogantly ignored his caution, feeling Daniel was trying to upstage him, most likely due to their dislike for each other. The machine exploded, scarring Chaos's face. He was soon dismissed for conducting unethical experiments. From then on, he blamed Daniel Evans for the destruction of his face as well as his dismissal. </p>
            <p><br>Disgraced and bitter, Chaos traveled the world and eventually came upon a small village of monks who assisted him in creating a suit of armor. He returned to his homeland of Serbia to overthrow the leader and declare himself king. He then began to use the country's resources in order to further develop his plans of world domination. These schemes led Chaos into conflict with the Light Team on many occasions, as well as many other heroes.</p>
            <p><br>Between his time stage (the principal realized time machine on the planet) and his chaosbots (automated copies of himself with artificial intelligence), Chaos is a splendid innovator and researcher. While in the meantime, he is a standout amongst the most dominant alchemists in presence, making him effectively among the most risky miscreants on the planet. The Alternate renditions recorded underneath are those of Terrence Lewis. Every single other form are nitty gritty in the Others area. </p>

			<h2>Chapter 2 - Climax</h2>
			<p><br>As part of the plan to rule the world, Chaos has kidnapped Ryan Reynolds, the mind-controlling villain known as The Psychic, and locked him within a gigantic Psycho-Drive which not only bestowed The Psychic's powers on Chaos, but also expanded them to a global scale.</p>
            <p><br>By this device, Chaos manipulated the world government to legally name him as the king of the planet. Under Chaos's command, the planet saw peace, prosperity, equality, and as well as the end of war and hunger, but at the cost of every single citizen's free will. Additionally, Chaos began to feel that his triumph was almost meaningless, due to any lack of challenge to achieve or maintain his vision.</p>
            <p><br>One challenger to Chaos's rule surfaced in the form of the Avenger Spectre, whose unusual physiology rendered him unaffected by Chaos's mind-control. After freeing several of his fellow teammates from Chaos's control, Spectre attacked the Chaos Island, the location of the Psycho-Drive. Chaos's dissatisfaction caused him to give up on a chance to prevent the heroes from destroying the Psycho-Drive. Thus, the citizens of the planet broke free from Chaos's control, and the planet soon returned back to normal.</p>

			<h2>Chapter 3 - Death</h2>
			<p><br>As part of a plan to conquer the world, Doom kidnapped Zebediah Killgrave, the mind-controlling supervillain known as Purple Man, and imprisoned him within a gigantic Psycho-Prism which not only bestowed Purple Man's powers on Doom, but also augmented them to a global scale.</p>
			<p><br>Using this device, Doom manipulated the United Nations and every government to legally name him emperor of the Earth. Under Doom's command, the planet saw prosperity, equality, and the end of war and hunger, but at the cost of every citizen's free will. Additionally, Doom began to feel that his victory was almost meaningless, due to any lack of challenge to achieve or maintain his goal.</p>

                <p><br>With Doom's lack of challenge, It decided to have a Battle Tournament that will be held every year to ammuse his violent heart. The winner will get to be his challenger to battle and will be rich if Doom will be defeated.</p>
