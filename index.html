                    <p><br>Terrence Lewis was born in a camp outside Belgrade, Serbia. His father, Jason, who was killed
                        in a bargain with Sarastro that went wrong. Despite his mother's attempts to care for him, a
                        nobleman died and Lisa Amato, his mother,
                        fled with a young Terrence on a cold winter's night. Terrence survived the cold, but
                        unfortunately his mother did not. Chaos sought to increase his knowledge of both science and
                        magic in order to rescue his father, whose death
                        he blamed on Sarastro. In his youth, Terrence fell in love with a woman named Anastasia, but she
                        resisted his advances.</p>
                    <p><br>The State University in Cambridge, Massachusetts offered Terrence a scholarship. While
                        attending classes there, he first met Daniel Evans and Allen Benson. Both whom developed a
                        dislike for each other, leading to Daniel Evans commiting
                        the first prank he had ever pulled, changing Terrence's last name on a trophy to "Doof." Chaos
                        became obsessed with developing a machine that could project the astral form of a being into
                        other dimensions, seeing it as a way to
                        free his father's soul from Sarastro's clutches. Daniel pointed out a flaw in Chaos's
                        calculations, but Chaos arrogantly ignored his caution, feeling Daniel was trying to upstage
                        him, most likely due to their dislike for each other.
                        The machine exploded, scarring Chaos's face. He was soon dismissed for conducting unethical
                        experiments. From then on, he blamed Daniel Evans for the destruction of his face as well as his
                        dismissal. </p>
                    <p><br>Disgraced and bitter, Chaos traveled the world and eventually came upon a small village of
                        monks who assisted him in creating a suit of armor. He returned to his homeland of Serbia to
                        overthrow the leader and declare himself king.
                        He then began to use the country's resources in order to further develop his plans of world
                        domination. These schemes led Chaos into conflict with the Light Team on many occasions, as well
                        as many other heroes.</p>
                    <p><br>Between his time stage (the principal realized time machine on the planet) and his chaosbots
                        (automated copies of himself with artificial intelligence), Chaos is a splendid innovator and
                        researcher. While in the meantime, he is
                        a standout amongst the most dominant alchemists in presence, making him effectively among the
                        most risky miscreants on the planet. The Alternate renditions recorded underneath are those of
                        Terrence Lewis. Every single other form
                        are nitty gritty in the Others area. </p>

            <h2>Chapter 2 - Climax</h2>
            <p><br>As part of the plan to rule the world, Chaos has kidnapped Ryan Reynolds, the mind-controlling
                villain known as The Psychic, and locked him within a gigantic Psycho-Drive which not only bestowed The
                Psychic's powers on Chaos, but also
                expanded them to a global scale.</p>
            <p><br>By this device, Chaos manipulated the world government to legally name him as the king of the planet.
                Under Chaos's command, the planet saw peace, prosperity, equality, and as well as the end of war and
                hunger, but at the cost of every
                single citizen's free will. Additionally, Chaos began to feel that his triumph was almost meaningless,
                due to any lack of challenge to achieve or maintain his vision.</p>
            <p><br>One challenger to Chaos's rule surfaced in the form of the Avenger Spectre, whose unusual physiology
                rendered him unaffected by Chaos's mind-control. After freeing several of his fellow teammates from
                Chaos's control, Spectre attacked
                the Chaos Island, the location of the Psycho-Drive. Chaos's dissatisfaction caused him to give up on a
                chance to prevent the heroes from destroying the Psycho-Drive. Thus, the citizens of the planet broke
                free from Chaos's control, and
                the planet soon returned back to normal.</p>

            <h2>Chapter 3 - Death</h2>
            <p><br>As a part of a plan to overcome the world, Doom kidnapped Zebediah Killgrave, the mind-controlling
                supervillain known as Purple Man, and detained him inside an enormous Psycho-Prism which presented
                Purple Man's forces on Doom, and also
                augmented them to a global scale. .

            </p>
            <p><br>Using this device, Doom controlled the United Nations and each government to legally name him emperor
                of the Earth. Under Doom's order, the planet saw prosperity, balance, and the finish of war and hunger,
                yet at the cost of each citizen's
                free will. Also, Doom started to feel that his triumph was practically insignificant, due to the absence
                of challenges to maintain his goal.</p>

            is very beautiful with his round, bright face which shines with soft and gentle light on all the world of
            man. But once there was a time when he was not so beautiful as he is now. Six thousand years ago the face of
            the Moon became changed
            in a single night. Before that time his face had been so dark and gloomy that no one liked to look at him,
            and for this reason he was always very sad.
            <br /><br /> One day he complained to the flowers and to the stars—for they were the only things that would
            ever look in his face.
            <br /><br /> Then the flowers smiled sweetly and said, "We do not know how we can help you. We live always
            in one place—in a garden near the most beautiful maiden in all the world. As she is kind to every one in
            trouble we will tell her about
            you. We love her very much and she loves us. Her name is Tseh-N'io." Still the Moon was sad. So one evening
            he went to see the beautiful maiden Tseh-N'io. And when he saw her he loved her at once. He said, "Your face
            is very beautiful. I wish
            that you would come to me, and that my face would be as your face. Your motions are gentle and full of
            grace. Come with me and we will be as one—and perfect. I know that even the worst people in all the world
            would have only to look at you
            and they would love you. Tell me, how did you come to be so beautiful?"
            <br /><br /> "I have always lived with those who were gentle and happy, and I believe that is the cause of
            beauty and goodness," answered Tseh-N'io.
            <br /><br /> And so the Moon went every night to see the maiden. He knocked on her window, and she came. And
            when he saw how gentle and beautiful she was, his love grew stronger, and he wished more and more to be with
            her always.
            <br /><br /> The face of the Moon is very beautiful now. It is happy and bright and gives a soft, gentle
            light to all the world. And there are those who say that the Moon is now like Tseh-N'io, who was once the
            most beautiful of all earth
            maidens.

                    <b>Sa isang mataas na bundok ay may mag-asawang Bathala na naninirahan ang pangalan ay sina Dayang
                        Makiling at Gat Panahon. May kaisa-isa silang anak na ubod ng ganda - si Maria. Kahit si Maria
                        ay isang Diyosa, nakikihalubilo siya sa mga tao, tulad ng ama at ina. Ang mga tao ay nakakahingi
                        ng tulong sa mga Bathala. Nasanay si Maria na magsuot ng damit ayon moda at ang mahahaba niyang
                        buhok ay napapalamutian ng bulaklak. Kapag araw ng palengke si Maria ay kasama ng dalawa niyang
                        alalay na nakikipagpalit ng kalakal sa mga tao. <br></b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Isang araw sa palengke, ang isang maharlikang lalaki ay dumating. Nakabanggaang balikat ni Maria ito
                    at nagkatinginan silang dalawa. Yumoko ang lalaki at humingi ng paumanhin kaalinsabay ay nagkakilala
                    sila. Ang lalaki pala ay si Gat Dula. Mula ng araw na iyon ay lagi nang nag-aabang tuwing araw ng
                    palengke si Gat Dula ngunit lagi siyang bigo. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maraming araw ng palengke ang lumipas hanggang minsan ay nasilayan din ni Gat Dula ang magandang si
                    Maria. Walang inaksayang sandali ang maharlikang lalaki at ka agad ay magalang niyang binati si
                    Maria. Tinugon naman ito ni Maria ng isang matamis ng ngiti. Mula noon ay naging magkaibigan na sila
                    na humantong sa pag-ibig. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nalimutan na ni Maria na isa siyang Diyosa na di dapat umibig sa tao. Nagalit ang mga magulang ni
                    Maria Makiling ng matuklasan nila ang pakikipag-ibigan ng anak nila sa tao. Mula noon ay nanging
                    bawal na kay Maria ang bumaba sa daigdig. Inalisan na siya ng kapangyarihan na mag anyong tao na
                    labis na ikinalungkot ni Maria. Sa daigdig nama'y sobra din ang kalungkutan ni Gat Dula. Madalas na
                    nakikita ni Gat Dula si Maria sa kaniyang pangitain ngunit ito'y biglang naglalahong parang bula.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biglang nilusob ng kalapit na kaharian, ang kaharian ni Gat Dula ngunit dahil sa marubdob na
                    pag-ibig ni Gat Dula kay Maria na nagsilbing inspirasyon at nagwagi si Gat Dula sa digmaan. Marami
                    pang digmaan ang pinagwagian ni Gat Dula maliban sa pag-ibig niya kay Maria Sa labis na kalungkutan
                    si Gat Dula ay nagkasakit na naging sanhi ng kanyang kamatayan. Lahat ng ito ay nakita ni Maria
                    ngunit wala siyang magawa. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nang mamatay ang Ama at Ina ni Maria ang lahat ng kayamanan at kapangyarihan ay ipinagkaloob kay
                    Maria. Dahil doon ay naipagpatuloy niya ang pagbibigay ng tulong sa kanyang nasaskupan. Ngunit
                    dumating ang panahon. inabuso ng mga mamamayan ang kabaitan ni Maria. Ang mga gamit na hinihiram
                    nila kay Maria ay di na isinosoli kaya't nagalit si Maria at ipinasya niya na baguhin ang lahat.
                    Binago ni Maria ang lahat ng kautusan at batas. Naging bawal nang mamitas ng anomang gulay at
                    prutas. Bawal ring manghuli ng hayop sa gubat at sinomang lumabag sa kautusan ay kaniyang
                    pinarurusahan.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ngayon ang bundok ng Makiling ay simbolo ng kapangyarihan at kagandahan ni Maria.
